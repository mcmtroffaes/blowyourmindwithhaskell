Science
-------

After receiving his M.Sc. degree in physical engineering in 2000
from Gent University, Belgium, Matthias C. M. Troffaes joined the SYSTeMS research group
at the same university as a doctoral researcher, pursuing research in
imprecise probability theory under the guidance of `Gert de Cooman <http://users.ugent.be/~gdcooma/>`_, earning the
degree of Ph.D. in April 2005. In July 2005, he went to Carnegie
Mellon University as a Francqui Foundation Fellow of the Belgian
American Educational Foundation, working as a post-doctoral researcher
with `Teddy Seidenfeld <http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/faculty-seidenfeld.php>`_.
In September 2006, he became a lecturer in statistics
at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University.

He authored and
co-authored numerous papers in the field of imprecise probability
theory and decision making, and co-edited special issues for various journals, including the
Journal of Statistical Practice and Applications, the Journal
of Risk and Reliability, and the International Journal of
Approximate Reasoning. Since 2009, he is member of the
executive committee of the Society for Imprecise Probability: Theories
and Applications (SIPTA).

Music
-----

Besides these scientific activities, he
studied harpsichord with Carine Verhenneman and organ with
Chris Dubois at the Conservatory of Brugge until 1994. From 1996 until
2002 he continued his harpsichord studies as a part-time student with
Carine Verhenneman at the Royal Conservatory of Gent, where he also
took classes in composition with
`Frank Nuyts <http://www.franknuyts.com/index.html>`_ and 
`Godfried-Willem Raes <http://www.logosfoundation.org/index-god.html>`_.
He has been pursuing his musical desires as a free-lance
harpsichord and organ player, concentrating on both Baroque and
contemporary music, improvisation, experimental methods, and the
combination of Baroque instruments with live electronics. In this
electronic and experimental spirit, he co-founded the
*SKORZA* ensemble in 2002,
together with
`Kristof Lauwers <http://kristoflauwers.domainepublic.net/>`_ and
Kerstin Olfe. Between 2006 and 2010, he sang as tenor
in the
`Durham Choral Society <http://www.durhamchoralsociety.org.uk>`_.
